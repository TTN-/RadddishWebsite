Project aim: to create a customized chat app for Radddish which maintains the casual atmosphere of Slack while allowing threaded messaging, to enable in-depth discussion on eg. links.

If you would like to get involved in this project go to P_website on the Radddish slack and ask about it.

Currently involved: Zoe, Jaram, Courtney, Jotham, Noel, Andrew, Luke, Chris

Current stage: very very basic requirements and design completed. We are planning to build *something* to understand our skills/limits and then scrap it and go back to the requirements stage.
